# Product Overview

## Name
Kaldic

## Product Purpose
A SaaS Web application which speeds up the feature annotation in orthomosaics and 3D point clouds resulting in drone mapping and the creationg of engineering-grade 2D and 3D CAD objects for these features. It offers an automatic pre-annotation phase powered by AI and a manual phase where the user can accept, correct, delete, or add the proposed annotations and CAD conversions. These phases can be iterated until the user is satisfied. The input to the app are a GeoTIFF or Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file with an orthomosaic and a corresponding point cloud file which contains the photogrammetrically calculated vertical dimension or LIDAR data in LAS or LAZ format. The input files are usually generated from drone-mapping imagery by a program like Agisoft Metashape. The output of the app is a DXF file, containing all the accepted CAD-converted raster features, which can be opened by any CAD program for downstream tasks.

## Target Users
All and any industry which works with CAD files: construction, infrastructure monitoring, architecture, engineering, etc.

## Key Features
The manual or semi-manual vectorization of raster features into CAD primitives is a lengthy and laborious process. Kaldic is meant to reduce the turnaround time by using AI and manual post-processing, using industry standard input and output files. It acts as a rapid but lightweight bridge between the raster images of photogrammetric application and the vector-based images of CAD applications.

## Business Objectives
1. Reduce the time of vectorizing an orthomosaic by 10-20 times.
2. Increase the accuracy of existing auto-annotation applications from 50-60% to over 90%.
3. Reduce the cost of having orthomosaics converted to engineering-grade CAD files by 2 or more times.
